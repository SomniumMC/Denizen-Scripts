    dialog: <green>The Storm is a magical event that occurs periodically. It cleanses areas with high magical concentration, essentially resetting them to a previous state. That's why we take shelter here - the bunker is specially warded against its effects.

    dialog: <green>Our scholars believe it's part of the natural magical cycle of our world. When too much magical energy accumulates in an area, the Storm appears to reset the balance. It's like how a forest fire clears old growth to make way for new life.
